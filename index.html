<div id="play">
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Yo guys! Sup?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> Fogell, where have you been, man? You almost gave me a goddamn heart attack. Let me see it. Did you chicken out or what?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> No noooo, man. I got it; it is flawless. Check it!?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="evan"><strong>Evan:</strong> [examining the fake ID]  Hawaii. All right, that's good. That's hard to trace, I guess. Wait... you changed your name to... McLovin?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Yeah.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="evan"><strong>Evan:</strong> McLovin? What kind of a stupid name is that, Fogell? What, are you trying to be an Irish R&B singer?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Naw, they let you pick any name you want when you get down there.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> And you landed on McLovin...</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Yeah. It was between that or Muhammed.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> Why would it be between THAT or Muhammed? Why don't you just pick a common name like a normal person?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Muhammed is the most commonly used name on Earth. Read a book for once.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="evan"><strong>Evan:</strong> Fogell, have you actually ever met anyone named Muhammed?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Have YOU actually ever met anyone named McLovin?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> No, that's why you picked a dumb name!</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> **** you.</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> Fogell, this ID says that you're 25 years old. Why wouldn't you just put 21, man?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> Seth, Seth, Seth. Listen up, every day, hundreds of kids go into the liquor store with their fake IDs,
        <br> and every single one says they're 21. Pssh, how many 21 year olds do you think there are in this town? It's called strategy, all right?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="evan"><strong>Evan:</strong> Stay calm, okay? Let's not lose our heads. It's... it's a fine ID; it'll... it's gonna work. 
        <br> It's passable, okay? This isn't terrible. I mean, it's up to you, Fogell. This guy is either gonna think 'Here's another kid with a fake ID'
        <br> or 'Here's McLovin, a 25 year-old Hawaiian organ donor'. Okay? So what's it gonna be?</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="fogell"><strong>Fogell:</strong> [grinning]  ... I am McLovin!</span></p> 
    <p><span data-actor="seth"><strong>Seth:</strong> No you're not. No one's McLovin. McLovin's never existed because that's a 
        <br> made up dumb FAIRY TALE NAME!</span></p>
